# Generate pdf and docx versions

Currently the code structure supports the generation of html, pdf, and docx formats.
Although be warned that building multiple versions does create some challenges.
I recommend this be maintained from throughout the project if the goal is publication and peer review.
Should docx and pdf versions not be needed (e.g. web based workbook only) delete the following lines from the `_output.yml` file.

```
bookdown::pdf_document2:
  latex_engine: pdflatex
  citation_package: natbib
  keep_tex: yes
  includes:
    in_header: preamble.tex
bookdown::word_document2: default
```

## PDF document tweaks

Numerous tweaks can be made to the pdf output.  Many adjustments can be made by editing the `premble.tex` file.  For example, line numbering can be turned off by commenting out lines `21 -22`.  Likewise linespacing can be removed commenting out lines `26-27`.  Note that in _LaTeX_ coding the `%` is a the comment symbol.
