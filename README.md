# Bookdown with code folding 

To use this repository clone it using git: `git clone https://github.com/ColinChisholm/bookdown_codefolding.git`    
Or click the code buttom above and then select download. 



This is an unofficial [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) project that includes a code-folding feature (i.e. view or hide code at the click of a button).

- bookdown is on github at: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown
- code folding was discussed and generally solved on [stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45360998/code-folding-in-bookdown).    
- [J. Zobolas](https://github.com/bblodfon) adapted it to [bookdown template](https://github.com/bblodfon/rtemps).  

This project simply includes minor tweak and examples that I have found useful.  It is intended for personal use but if you like it please feel free to use it. 

Last update adds: 
1. A number of resources for working with rmarkdown and bookdown
2. Examples for:
    - citing literature
    - creating cross references 
    - inserting images and plots with figure captions and cross-referencing
    - inserting tables with captions and cross referencing
