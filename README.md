# Bookdown with code folding 

A [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) template with code folding

- bookdown is on github at: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown
- code folding was discussed and generally solved on [stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45360998/code-folding-in-bookdown).  @bblodfon adapted it to [bookdown template](https://github.com/bblodfon/rtemps).  

This project simplpy includes any minor tweaks that I have made to the template.
