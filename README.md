# Bookdown with code folding 

A [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) template with code folding

- bookdown is on github at: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown
- code folding was discussed and generally solved on [stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45360998/code-folding-in-bookdown).  [J. Zobolas](https://github.com/bblodfon) adapted it to [bookdown template](https://github.com/bblodfon/rtemps).  

This project simply includes any minor tweaks that I have made to the template.  It is intended for personal use but if you like it please feel free to use it. 

Last update adds: 
1. A number of resources for working with rmarkdown and bookdown,
2. Examples for:
    - citing literature
    - creating cross references 
    - inserting images and plots with figure captions and cross-referencing
    - inserting tables with captions and cross referencing
